# dBCalc
An android app for calculating the output dB of your headphones

This is still in the very early concept stages, as this is one of my first Android apps and work on this on my free time from University.

It currently only calculates the theoretical output dB given the specs of a pair of headphones (resistance and efficency/sensitivity) and the output voltage for the device playing the audio.


I hope to someday have it calculate the "real-time" output dB of the phone as automatically as possible. 
For this I will need it to automatically calculate the voltage output for as many devices as possible and the specs for various popular headphones.
